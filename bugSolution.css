The solution lies in understanding and carefully managing CSS specificity.  Avoid relying too heavily on `!important` as it can lead to difficult-to-maintain styles.

Instead of using `!important`, use more specific selectors to override styles.  In this example, if we want the `.parent .child` to be green, simply remove the `!important` from `.child`. 

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

This revised CSS achieves the desired result without using `!important`, making it more maintainable and predictable.
